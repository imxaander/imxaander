# About Me
  I am `Xander Ison` a 19 year old computer enthusiast that believes using computer is the best way to. I am somewhat experienced in web technologies (including databases, web servers), game development, and in general programming.

  I am currently a **student assistant backend developer** and **project repository manager** for a current web development project of our web development team in our school, under the administration of management information system. 

  I started programming (2017) using visual programming that scratch uses i dont even know what is programming in general, learned about who the hell is MIT, sparked the dedication to learn in around 2018-2019, the covid-19 struck the whole world, stayed in computer for hours just to cope, created tools for my school projects even though i sometimes prioritized my personal projects than school (it is very demotivating), times passed, continued learning programming while schooling, burnouts encountered, make games tools for random needs, congrats for reading all the way through, here's a ðŸ«€.

  I dont believe i write the best code, but i believe i am the worst programmer ever.
  
## I use Linux
  Not for a quite time but i just want to say i use linux ok my tech stack includes codeigniter, html css js, sql php. But i can also code in c/c++, java, python, and bash. I use unity mainly for game development, but i have experiences in ct.js, phaser,js
